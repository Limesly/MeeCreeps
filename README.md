# Bluebox Fork For Meecreeps
This fork is intended to expand on the features of this mod; furthur updating it to give more functionality to the portal gun, and possibly more balance.

# Plans and Ideas:
Portal Gun:
* A lot more space for saving locations
* Allowing the player to "create" destinations without needing to have been at that location, similar to how Rick can portal anywhere in the universe by just dialing it up
* Adding the self destruct feature to the portal gun :)
* Allow the player to place portals within liquids and possibly withing cramped locations such as 1x1 holes
* Allow players to choose between contact portals, which are made when the projectile hits a wall, or distance portals, which are opened mid air after a certain distance has been traveled
* Add hotkeys which allow the player to change their destinations while on the run rather than having to stop to select a destination
* Allow the player to change how long they want their portals to stay open or if they want them to close at all
* Possibly - Add a new "math" area, which will allow players to make their portal gun lethal either intentionally or by accident
* Possibly - Allow blocks or liquids to travel through portals

Possible Blue Portal Gun:
* A Portal gun that acts similar to the current version of the portal gun, where you're required to have been somewhere in order to portal back to those destinations
* Would act as the 1st tier to portal gun technology, thereby having less features and being less efficient
* May even be limited to same dimension teleportation

Visory or Survey Aid:
* some kind of device that can allow the player to see where their new destination is and whether its safe to portal there or not
* Could be a pair of goggles
* Maybe a little robot or camera that goes through the portal
* Might even be a simple handheld tool that gives environmental information about the destination
